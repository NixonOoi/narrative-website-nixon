            <p>According to legend, he was a highly skilled archer and swordsman.[1] In some versions of the legend, he is depicted as being of noble birth, and in modern retellings he is sometimes depicted as having fought in the Crusadesbefore returning to England to find his lands taken by the Sheriff. In the oldest known versions, he is instead a member of the yeoman class. Traditionally depicted dressed in Lincoln green, he is said to have stolen from the rich to give to the poor.</p>

            <p>Robin Hood was a young man living in England’s Sherwood Forest of Nottingham. The Sheriff of Nottingham was the arch-enemy of Robin Hood as Robin would loot the rich people who went through the Sherwood Forest. A lot of people of Nottingham supported Robin and called him their leader. They would always supply the information to him and be loyal to him.</p>
    
            <p>One day the Sheriff plotted a plan with noblemen to catch Robin Hood. His plan included an archery competition with a golden arrow as a prize, which Robin could not refuse as he loved archery very much. Despite his loyal people warning him, Robin went to the archery competition.</p>
    
            <p>On the day of the competition, the Sheriff had planted his guards everywhere to catch Robin wherever they saw him. Every participant in the competition wore green suits, and Robin was nowhere to be seen. The competition started, and all participants tried their hands at archery. In the final round, William, the Sheriff’s man, shot his arrow, which went very close to the centre. Another man shot an arrow that went straight through William’s arrow and into the bull’s eye. He was none other than Robin Hood. The crowd hysterically cheered for him. Before the Sheriff could understand that the last participant was none other than Robin Hood, Robin hopped on his horse and escaped.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Theory & Controversy</h2>
            <p>He appears not so much as a revolt against societal standards as an embodiment of them, being generous, pious, and courteous, opposed to stingy, worldly, and churlish foes.[36] Other scholars have by contrast stressed the subversive aspects of the legend, and see in the medieval Robin Hood ballads a plebeian literature hostile to the feudal order.</p>
    
            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Robin became a popular folk hero because of his generosity to the poor and down-trodden peasants, and his hatred of the Sheriff and his verderers who enforced the oppressive forest laws, made him their champion. Some chroniclers date his exploits as taking place during the reign of Edward II, but other versions say the king was Richard I, the Lionheart. Robin having fought in the Crusades alongside the Lionheart before returning to England to find his lands siezed by the Sheriff. </p>
